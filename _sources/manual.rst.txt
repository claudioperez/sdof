Lightning-fast integration of single degree-of-freedom systems.

--------------

This package solves scalar differential equations of the form

.. math::


   m \ddot{u} + c \dot{u} + k u = f(t)

Integration is carried out using a Generalized - :math:`\alpha`
integrator that is implemented under the hood in highly optimized
multi-threaded C code.

Generalized - :math:`\alpha` is an implicit method that allows for high
frequency energy dissipation and second order accuracy. With the right
selection of parameters, the method can be specialized to the
Hibert-Hughes-Taylor (HHT), or Newmark families of integration schemes.

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a
Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived
objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for
fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation,
sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra,
basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

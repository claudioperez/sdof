# Standard Univariate Models of Metallic Hysteresis

Scope is limited to point stress-strain relations. This excludes models which attempt to account for geometric effects, like cast fuse models for braced frames.
Formulations:

  - ODE Models
  - DAE Models
  - Rule-based models

Conclusions:

  - Consistency
  - Experiments

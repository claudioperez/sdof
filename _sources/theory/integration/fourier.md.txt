# Fourier

The transfer function $H$ is the Laplace transform of the impulse response.
The transfer function provides a complete mathematical representation of the system's behavior.

The frequency response is the Fourier transform of the impulse response.

The frequency response is a special case of the Laplace transfer function where the transients are assumed to be completely dissipated, leaving the steady state sinusoidal response.

The frequency response and transfer function are equivalent when the real part $\sigma$  of the  transfer function's complex variable $s=\sigma+j \omega$ is zero.
A frequency response describes a linear time-invariant (LTI) system.

A system with non-zero initial conditions is not LTI because its output has a component which only depends on the initial conditions and which is independent of the input signal. Consequently, a system with non-zero initial conditions cannot fully be described by a frequency response. If you assume zero initial conditions, then such a system (if otherwise LTI) can be described by a frequency response.

Complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of LTI systems. 


$$
\phi =  \tan^{-1}\frac{2\zeta \omega / \omega_n}{1 - (\omega/\omega_n)^2} = \tan^{-1} -\frac{\Im H(\omega)}{\Re H(\omega)} 
$$

Consider the Fourier transform $G(\omega,\tau)$ of the impulse response $g(t,\tau)$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
G(\omega,\tau)&=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  e^{i \omega t} g\left(t, \tau\right) d t \\
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\left[-\omega^2-2 i \gamma \omega+\omega_0^2\right] G\left(\omega, \tau\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i \omega t} \delta\left(t-\tau\right) d t  =e^{i \omega \tau}
$$
$$
G\left(\omega, \tau\right)=\frac{e^{i \omega \tau}}{-\omega_0^2 + \omega^2 + 2 i \gamma \omega}
$$


The first thing to notice is that the Green's function depends on $t$ and $\tau$ only in the combination $t-\tau$. This makes sense: the response of the oscillator to the force pulse should only depend on the time elapsed since the pulse. We can exploit this property by re-defining the frequency-domain Green's function as
$$
G(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i \omega\left(t-\tau\right)} g\left(t-\tau\right) \, d t
$$
which then obeys
$$
\left[-\omega^2-2 i \gamma \omega+\omega_0^2\right] G(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{i \omega (t-\tau)} \delta\left(t-\tau\right)\, d t =e^{i \omega \tau}=1 .
$$
so
$$
H(\omega)=\frac{{Y}(\omega)}{{F}(\omega)}=\frac{1}{\omega_0^2-\omega^2 + 2 i \gamma \omega} .
$$
For a system with an arbitrary initial displacement, $u_0$, and arbitrary initial velocity, $\dot{u}_0$, Eq. 9 should be generalized as follows:
$$
Y(\omega)=H(\omega)F(\omega)+H(\omega)\left[m\left(2 \zeta p+i \omega\right) u_0 +m \dot{u}_0\right] 
$$




## Laplace

$$
Y(s) = H(s) F(s)
$$
$$
H(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{F(s)}=\frac{\mathcal{L}\{y(t)\}}{\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\}}
$$

The eigenfunction property of exponentials is very useful for both analysis and insight into LTI systems. The one-sided Laplace transform
$$
H(s) \stackrel{\text { def }}{=} \mathcal{L}\{h(t)\} \stackrel{\text { def }}{=} \int_0^{\infty} h(t) e^{-s t} \mathrm{~d} t
$$
is exactly the way to get the eigenvalues from the impulse response. Of particular interest are pure sinusoids (i.e., exponential functions of the form $e^{j \omega t}$ where $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$ and $j \stackrel{\text { def }}{=} \sqrt{-1})$. The Fourier transform $H(j \omega)=\mathcal{F}\{h(t)\}$ gives the eigenvalues for pure complex sinusoids. Both of $H(s)$ and $H(j \omega)$ are called the system function, system response, or transfer function.

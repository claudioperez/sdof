A Green's function, $g(t, \tau)$, of a linear differential operator $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{L}(t)$ acting on distributions over a subset of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, at a point $s$, is any solution of

$$
\mathrm{L} g(t, \tau)=\delta(\tau - t).
$$

Loosely speaking, if such a function $g$ can be found for the operator $\mathrm{L}$, then, if we multiply the equation (1) for the Green's function by $f(s)$, and then integrate with respect to $\tau$, we obtain,
$$
\int \mathrm{L} g(t, \tau) f(s) d \tau = \int \delta(x=t-\tau) f(\tau) d \tau = f(t) .
$$

Because the operator $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{L}(t)$ is linear and acts only on the variable $t$ (and not on the variable of integration $s$ ), one may take the operator $\mathrm{L}$ outside of the integration, yielding
$$
\mathrm{L}\left(\int g(t, \tau) f(\tau) d \tau\right)=f(t) .
$$
The particular solution is then
$$
u_p(t)=\int g(t, \tau) f(\tau) d \tau
$$
and
$$
u = u_0(t) + u_p(t)=u_0(t) + \int g(t, \tau) f(\tau) d \tau
$$


Duhamel's principle is the result that the solution to an inhomogeneous, linear, partial differential equation can be solved by first finding the solution for a step input, and then superposing using Duhamel's integral. Suppose we have a constant coefficient, $m$-th order inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation.
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{L}\left(\partial_t\right) u(t)=f(t) \\
& \partial_t^j u(0)=0, \quad 0 \leq j \leq m-1
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
where
$$
\mathrm{L}\left(\partial_t\right):=a_m \partial_t^m+\cdots+a_1 \partial_t+a_0, a_m \neq 0 .
$$

We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined.

First let $g$ solve
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{L}\left(\partial_t\right) g&=0,\\
\partial_t^j g(0)&=0, \quad 0 \leq j \leq m-2, \\
\partial_t^{m-1} g(0)&=1 / a_m .
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

Define $h = g{\Theta_{[0, \infty)}}$, with $\Theta_{[0, \infty)}$ being the characteristic function of the interval $[0, \infty)$. Then we have
$$
\mathrm{L}\left(\partial_t\right) h=\delta
$$
in the sense of distributions. Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
u(t) & =(h * f)(t) \\
& =\int_0^{\infty} g(\tau) f(t-\tau) d \tau \\
& =\int_{-\infty}^t g(t-\tau) f(\tau) d \tau
\end{aligned}
$$


> - The Green's function as used in physics is usually defined with the opposite sign, instead. That is,
$\mathrm{L} g(t, \tau)=\delta(t-\tau)$.
> - This can be thought of as an expansion of $f$ according to a Dirac delta function basis (projecting $f$ over $\delta(x-s)$; and a superposition of the solution on each projection. Such an integral equation is known as a Fredholm integral equation, the study of which constitutes Fredholm theory.

-   If the operator is translation invariant, that is, when $\mathrm{L}$ has constant coefficients with respect to $t$, then the Green's function can be taken to be a convolution kernel, that is,
    $$
    G(t, s)=G(t-s) .
    $$

    **In this case, Green's function is the same as the impulse response of linear time-invariant system theory.**

- a fundamental solution for a linear partial differential operator $L$ is a formulation in the language of distribution theory of the older idea of a Green's function (although unlike Green's functions, fundamental solutions do not address boundary conditions).
- the fundamental solution matrix $\mathbf{U}(t)$  satisfies $\dot{\mathbf{U}}(t)=\mathbf{A}(t) \mathbf{U}(t)$ with initial condition $\mathbf{U}\left(t_0\right)=I$

- The fundamental solution is not uniquely determined. If $U$ is a fundamental solution and $v$ is any solution to the homogeneous equation $L(v)=0$, then $U+v$ is also a fundamental solution.
